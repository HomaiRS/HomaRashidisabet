                      <b> Abstract: </b>
                        Ubiquitous use of smartphones has significantly shaped interpersonal communications in modern life, in particular interactions via text messaging. To study the underlying dynamics of these smartphone-based human communications, we used a unique smartphone typing dataset that was passively and unobtrusively collected in-the-wild from 296 users via a custom-made iPhone keyboard. To reliably and accurately characterize the underlying distribution of the inter-event time between two consecutive keypresses, we (i) developed a statistical approach that integrates existing methods for estimating power-law distribution, and (ii) showed that power-law is a plausible candidate to represent human typing dynamics. We designed synthetic-data simulations in multiple scenarios where the synthetic data may or may not imitate human typing characteristics. Using numerical simulations, we showed that our approach, in all scenarios, improves the accuracy and stability of power-law estimates upon the common methods. We further demonstrated that when the synthetic data follow human typing characteristics, common methods lead to significant misestimations of power-law exponent as they fail to take into account the key characteristics of the observed data. More broadly, our approach applies beyond the power-law estimation for human typing dynamics data.

                                  This review article summarizes how emerging connected technologies (e.g., smartphones and wearables) may provide
                                  novel avenues to understand an individual's behavior through the lens of systems biology. First, we surveyed
                                  recent research efforts that leveraged the multimodal high temporal resolution data derived from connected devices
                                  to build digital phenotypes and/or discover digital biomarkers of the behaviorome. We write this review with a
                                  particular emphasis on the detection, diagnosis, and symptom monitoring of neuropsychiatric disorders, as these
                                  pathologies may manifest primarily as disruptions to the behaviorome. We then discussed new opportunities and
                                  challenges these state-of-art research efforts bring as they intersect with other areas of natural and social
                                  sciences. Ultimately, we suggest how incorporating systems biology and connected technologies data can lead to
                                  a better understanding of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.

                    <br />
                    <b> Objective </b>
                    Ubiquitous technologies can be leveraged to construct ecologically relevant metrics that
                    complement traditional psychological assessments. This study aims to determine the feasibility
                    of smartphone-derived real-world keyboard metadata to serve as digital biomarkers of mood.
                    <br />
                    <b> Materials and Methods </b>
                    BiAffect, a real-world observation study based on a freely available iPhone app, allowed the
                    unobtrusive collection of typing metadata through a custom virtual keyboard that replaces the
                    default keyboard. User demographics and self-reports for depression severity (Patient Health
                    Questionnaire-8) were also collected. Using &gt 14 million keypresses from 250 users who reported
                    demographic information and a subset of 147 users who additionally completed at least 1 Patient
                    Health Questionnaire, we employed hierarchical growth curve mixed-effects models to capture the
                    effects of mood, demographics, and time of day on keyboard metadata.
                    <br />
                    <b> Results </b>
                    We analyzed 86 541 typing sessions associated with a total of 543 Patient Health Questionnaires.
                    Results showed that more severe depression relates to more variable typing speed (<i>P</i> < 0.001), shorter
                    session duration (<i>P</i> < .001), and lower accuracy (<i>P</i> < .05). Additionally, typing speed and variability
                    exhibit a diurnal pattern, being fastest and least variable at midday. Older users exhibit slower and
                    more variable typing, as well as more pronounced slowing in the evening. The effects of aging and time
                    of day did not impact the relationship of mood to typing variables and were recapitulated in the 250-user group.
                    <br />
                    <b> Conclusions </b>
                    Keystroke dynamics, unobtrusively collected in the real world, are significantly associated with mood despite
                    diurnal patterns and effects of age, and thus could serve as a foundation for constructing digital biomarkers.

                            <b> Abstract: </b>
                            Over the past decade, with promising results of Deep Learning (DL) in computer vision, the applications in ophthalmic imaging data have been increasing exponentially. However, overfitting and lack of generalizability are always a concern when DL models are developed over a single data set. Many of the past Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) studies have used standardized publicly available datasets having similar properties while almost none of them follows the complex characteristics of Real-World (RW) data. We study the generalizability of AI models trained on public versus RW data for two different popular tasks in ophthalmology research including glaucoma classification and Optic Disc (OD) segmentation. We used Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary fundus dataset as an example for RW data along with six well-studied publicly available fundus datasets. We showed that even though public trained models have the highest accuracy on public data (0.88% for glaucoma classification, and 0.94% for OD segmentation), their accuracy drops by 16% and 8% for each task when the model was tested on the RW data. However, RW trained model performs stably across all datasets and its performance generalizes to both public and RW data verified on both tasks. Our work suggests that the standardized publicly available data are not a good representation of the RW data, and the models trained on them cannot effectively generalize to RW data.

                                    POAG patients are typically unaware of their visual field (VF) abnormality; therefore, it is
                                    critical to identify progressive glaucoma for early and adequate intervention. Before the advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT), glaucoma progression relied on assessments of the optic nerve during clinical examination and VF analysis over time. However, these assessments were subjective and qualitative, thereby limiting accuracy of detecting severity of glaucoma. The introduction of OCT imaging has provided accurate and detailed quantitative information of various retinal layers. The objective of our study is to systematically review and succinctly analyze studies that correlate OCT-based parameters with VF progression in glaucoma suspect and/or POAG patients. Finally, we discuss gaps in our current understanding of glaucoma management and propose directions for future studies.

                            <b> Abstract: </b>
                            Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness wherein relapses contribute to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Near-term prediction of relapses in MDD patients has the potential to improve outcomes by helping implement a ‘predict and preempt’ paradigm in clinical care. In this study, we developed a novel personalized (N-of-1) encoder-decoder anomaly detection (EncDec-AD) based relapse prediction framework utilizing sensor data (passive) and self-report symptom assessments (active). The prediction framework combines passive and active data streams in an adaptive manner to minimize patient and provider burden while predicting majority of relapses. The framework was evaluated on two independent longitudinal observational trials, characterized by regular bimonthly (every other month) in person clinical assessments, weekly self-reported symptom assessments, and continuous activity monitoring data with two different wearable sensors for ≥1 year or until the first relapse or recurrence episode. The EncDec-AD model was continuously trained on features derived from actigraphy data and used to detect anomalies in subsequent actigraphy data. Any anomaly thus detected was combined with nearest available self-reported symptomatology questionnaire (core-symptoms of depression and anxiety) to predict an imminent relapse. This combined passive-active relapse prediction framework achieved a balanced accuracy of ≥71%, false alarm rate of ≤2.3 alarm/patient/year with a median relapse detection time of 2 to 3 weeks in advance of clinical onset in both studies. The study results suggest that the proposed personalized N-of-1 prediction framework is generalizable and can help predict majority of MDD relapses in an actionable time frame with relatively low patient and provider burden.

                <b> Abstract: </b>
                Deep Learning (DL) models in the domain of (medical) computer vision have become increasingly complex and have a high capacity to learn complex underlying relationships in the data. However, this high learning power could come at the cost of a high tendency for overfitting. Overfitted model, instead of learning the actual signal correlated to the target variable, learns random fluctuations in training data that might not apply to the test data, and it misses the global patterns in the training set which negatively impacts the model’s ability to generalize on future data. Traditional methods of dealing with overfitting often fail in medical applications. This is due to limited amounts of labeled data in the medical domain. Acquiring labeled data in healthcare is an ongoing challenge as the labeling process not only is time-consuming and expensive but also requires at least two expert graders. Therefore, this work presents the stabilized optimization method to train a deep learning model on small labeled medical datasets with reduced variance.

However, this high learning power could come at the cost of a high tendency for overfitting.

Therefore, overfitted model misses the global patterns in the training set which negatively impacts its ability to generalize on future data. Acquiring labels in healthcare is an ongoing challenge as the labeling process not only is time-consuming and expensive but also requires at least two expert graders. Therefore, due to limited amounts of labeled data in the medical domain, existing methods requiring lots of labels for the classification task are not optimized for medical applications. Therefore, a method requiring small labeled data for classifying images as different classes is necessary here. To this end, we extend and tailor a recently developed method called Classification via Segmentation (CvS) that is capable of using the power of the segmentation network in small data for classifying images, for medical applications.

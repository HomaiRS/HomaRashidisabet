                                  This review article summarizes how emerging connected technologies (e.g., smartphones and wearables) may provide
                                  novel avenues to understand an individual's behavior through the lens of systems biology. First, we surveyed
                                  recent research efforts that leveraged the multimodal high temporal resolution data derived from connected devices
                                  to build digital phenotypes and/or discover digital biomarkers of the behaviorome. We write this review with a
                                  particular emphasis on the detection, diagnosis, and symptom monitoring of neuropsychiatric disorders, as these
                                  pathologies may manifest primarily as disruptions to the behaviorome. We then discussed new opportunities and
                                  challenges these state-of-art research efforts bring as they intersect with other areas of natural and social
                                  sciences. Ultimately, we suggest how incorporating systems biology and connected technologies data can lead to
                                  a better understanding of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.

                    <b> Abstract: </b>
                    <br />
                    <b> Objective </b>
                    Ubiquitous technologies can be leveraged to construct ecologically relevant metrics that
                    complement traditional psychological assessments. This study aims to determine the feasibility
                    of smartphone-derived real-world keyboard metadata to serve as digital biomarkers of mood.
                    <br />
                    <b> Materials and Methods </b>
                    BiAffect, a real-world observation study based on a freely available iPhone app, allowed the
                    unobtrusive collection of typing metadata through a custom virtual keyboard that replaces the
                    default keyboard. User demographics and self-reports for depression severity (Patient Health
                    Questionnaire-8) were also collected. Using &gt 14 million keypresses from 250 users who reported
                    demographic information and a subset of 147 users who additionally completed at least 1 Patient
                    Health Questionnaire, we employed hierarchical growth curve mixed-effects models to capture the
                    effects of mood, demographics, and time of day on keyboard metadata.
                    <br />
                    <b> Results </b>
                    We analyzed 86 541 typing sessions associated with a total of 543 Patient Health Questionnaires.
                    Results showed that more severe depression relates to more variable typing speed (<i>P</i> < 0.001), shorter
                    session duration (<i>P</i> < .001), and lower accuracy (<i>P</i> < .05). Additionally, typing speed and variability
                    exhibit a diurnal pattern, being fastest and least variable at midday. Older users exhibit slower and
                    more variable typing, as well as more pronounced slowing in the evening. The effects of aging and time
                    of day did not impact the relationship of mood to typing variables and were recapitulated in the 250-user group.
                    <br />
                    <b> Conclusions </b>
                    Keystroke dynamics, unobtrusively collected in the real world, are significantly associated with mood despite
                    diurnal patterns and effects of age, and thus could serve as a foundation for constructing digital biomarkers.

                              <b> Abstract: </b>
                              Over the past decade, with promising results of Deep Learning (DL) in computer vision, the applications in ophthalmic imaging data have been increasing exponentially. However, overfitting and lack of generalizability are always a concern when DL models are developed over a single data set. Many of the past Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) studies have used standardized publicly available datasets having similar properties while almost none of them follows the complex characteristics of Real-World (RW) data. We study the generalizability of AI models trained on public versus RW data for two different popular tasks in ophthalmology research including glaucoma classification and Optic Disc (OD) segmentation. We used Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary fundus dataset as an example for RW data along with six well-studied publicly available fundus datasets. We showed that even though public trained models have the highest accuracy on public data (0.88% for glaucoma classification, and 0.94% for OD segmentation), their accuracy drops by 16% and 8% for each task when the model was tested on the RW data. However, RW trained model performs stably across all datasets and its performance generalizes to both public and RW data verified on both tasks. Our work suggests that the standardized publicly available data are not a good representation of the RW data, and the models trained on them cannot effectively generalize to RW data.
